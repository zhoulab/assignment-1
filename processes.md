## Annotation analysis

    do_anno_analysis()

For each .anno file in the **Dm** and **Mammals** directories, get occurence counts under the 'Annotation' column for:

1. non-coding
2. Intergenic
3. intron
4. exon
5. promoter-TSS
6. TTS
7. 5' UTR
8. 3' UTR

Output a summary .txt (tab-delimited text) file for each anno folder including total counts for each .anno file.

Generate pie charts for each file with a consistent color-to-value legend.
